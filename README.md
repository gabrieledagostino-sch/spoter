# Spoter

Spoter is a web app that makes discovering new music easy and straigthforward. Just search for a track, an autor or a genre that you like and it will use spotify APIs to make suggestions. It will show a preview and just by swiping left or right you tell your interest. You can then go in your profile and make a playlist out of those interests.
